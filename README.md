# CP1404 Practicals
Name: Runjie Jiang
Major: Information Technology

## Introduction
All my CP1404 assignments are included here and can be found in different files.

## Clean code
I learned the following about clean code:
- Use a clean and non-repetitive approach to presentation.
- Use consistent indentation, spacing and naming conventions. Make the code easier to read and understand and debugging.
- Use meaningful names and choose descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Communicate the purpose and function of these names effectively and easily.
