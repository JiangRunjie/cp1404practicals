Estimation of the practical tasks

Throughout the course, I thought that each weekly practical task would take about three to four days to complete, and the whole topic would take about a month combined. At first, I had difficulty identifying and understanding the logic in the code accurately and my memory of the code would be confused, which had a significant impact on my overall efficiency. As the course progressed, I found it easier to remember and use the code more accurately because I was using it more. This change has allowed me to solve tasks more efficiently and has steadily improved the accuracy of my code throughout the subject.

Code Review

Reviewing code and being reviewed by others was an interesting experience. It has allowed me to significantly improve my proficiency in computing code. This feedback mechanism helps me to continuously improve the readability and accuracy of my code. Conversely, when I review other people's code, it allows me to learn different ways to approach problems. And change my shortcomings.

Practical tasks

If I were in charge of this topic, I would make some changes to the practical tasks. For example, I would add different patterns of approaches to solve the same problem that could help students' understanding of the code and know which approach is more effective.
